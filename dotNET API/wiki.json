MapleSim generates model equations, runs simulations, and performs analyses using the symbolic and numeric mathematical engine of [[Maple (software)|Maple]]. Models are created by [[Drag-and-drop|dragging-and-dropping]] components from a library into a central workspace, resulting in a model that represents the physical system in a graphical form.\nMaplesoft began development of MapleSim partly in response to a request from [[Toyota Canada Inc.|Toyota]] to produce physical modeling tools to aid in their new model-based development process.<ref>[http://www.proe.com/feature_full.php?cpfeatureid=30189 The Simulation Landscape: Products and New Releases in Simulation Software], ProE Community, Sep 15, 2008</ref><ref>http://www.solidedgecommunity.com/feature_full.php?cpfeatureid=30190 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716102850/http://www.solidedgecommunity.com/feature_full.php?cpfeatureid=30190 |date=July 16, 2011 }} A first look at MapleSim</ref>\n\nThe MapleSim library includes many components that can be connected together to model a system. These components are from areas of science and engineering such as [[Electronics|electrical]], [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337â€“359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}</ref> and [[Thermodynamics|thermal]] engineering fields. MapleSim also includes traditional signal flow components that can be combined with other physical components in the workspace. Thus, MapleSim is able to combine [[Causal#Engineering|causal]] modeling methods with [[Anticausal system|acausal]] techniques that do not require specification of signal flow direction between all components.<ref>[http://www.scientific-computing.com/features/feature.php?feature_id=208 European Models Promote Fidelity], Scientific Computing World, August 2008</ref>\n\nThe use of Maple underneath MapleSim allows all of the system equations to be generated and simplified automatically. The user can explore their system in various ways, such as viewing the equations behind their model and performing parameter optimization.<ref>[http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aaakrm.htm Modelica Aims for Effective Model-based Simulation], Desktop Engineering Online, Sep 1, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aaanpf.htm Editor's Pick: MapleSim Handles Multidomain Modeling & Simulation], Desktop Engineering Online, Jan 21, 2009,</ref> The use of the Maple mathematics engine also allows for MapleSim to incorporate such features as units management and solving of high-order [[differential algebraic equation|DAEs]] that are typically encountered in complex acausal models.<ref>[http://www.controleng.com/index.asp?layout=article&articleid=CA6579839&article_prefix=CA&article_id=6579839&q=Maplesoft Mechatronics: Next generation tool for modeling and simulation], Control Engineering, July 28, 2008</ref>\n\n== Release history ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: left; \"\n|-\n!
